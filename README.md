# References to reused code from third-party projects
Note that the GRASSMIND3.0 model is a recoded and restructured model version of the GRASSMIND2.0 model 
which has originally been derived and developed from the forest model FORMIND (https://formind.org/). 
GRASSMIND3.0 thus partly contains functions of the FORMIND model which fall under the respective copyright and license.
We provide reference for the reused functions directly in the source code and in the model description of GRASSMIND3.0.
For copyright and license of FORMIND, we refer to: https://formind.org/downloads/downloads-terms-and-conditions/

Note that the GRASSMIND3.0 model also partly contains recoded functions and modelling approaches of the CENTURY4.0 soil model
which fall under the respective copyright and license. We provide reference for the reused functions directly in the source code 
and in the model description of GRASSMIND3.0. For copyright and license of the CENTURY soil model, we refer to: https://www.soilcarbonsolutionscenter.com/century-agreement and https://www2.nrel.colostate.edu/projects/irc/#.

## Usage
To run model simulations, we refer to an exemplary batch script (https://github.com/BioDT/uc-grassland/blob/main/run_pipeline_uc_grassland.cmd) that uses input data generated by https://github.com/BioDT/uc-grassland, https://github.com/BioDT/general-soilgrids-soil-data and https://github.com/BioDT/general-copernicus-weather-data.
